# The AKER map

## Quickstart

### Windows
1. `npm install`
2. `postinstall.bat`
3. `dev.bat`
4. open [http://localhost:8080/webpack-dev-server/](http://localhost:8080/webpack-dev-server/).

### *nix
1. `npm install`
2. `./postinstall`
3. `./dev`
4. open [http://localhost:8080/webpack-dev-server/](http://localhost:8080/webpack-dev-server/).


## Development tips
* If you need the website without the Frame of Webpack around it, you can open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) directly.
* Disallow geolocation detection - this does not only make your reload cycle faster, but also centers the map to Denver with 4 pre-defined pins right on the map.

This is work in progress...
