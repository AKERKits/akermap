For the icons `[1-9]plus.svg` the font Raleway Black in 36pt (125%) was used.
It can be found on [Google Fonts](www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Raleway) or [Fontsquirrel](www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/raleway).
The font has been broken up in paths within the pins, so if you need to edit them, you will need to recreate the glyphs.
